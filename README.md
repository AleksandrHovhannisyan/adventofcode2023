# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 problems.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repo.
2. To compile the solutions for a day, run `cd dayn && make`, replacing `n` with the day number (e.g., `day1`).
3. Run the compiled executable (either `01` or `02` for parts 1 and 2, respectively).
